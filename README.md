## Contributing
To add a new locale is pretty simple just follow the layout in [./lang/en.js](./lang/en.js) and make sure you add it to [locales.config](./locales.config.js)

__**NOTE:**__ You do not need to translate any HTML Tags just leave them where and how they are and translate the content inside of them. Our website is setup to read these tags.
